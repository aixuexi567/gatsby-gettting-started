with `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, you can also add frontmatter to your MDX files.

**frontmatter** is additional metadata about your file.
It won't be rendered on your page, but it's a way for you to add some extra details about your content. Here's an example:

```
---
name: "huan-post"
datePublished: "2023-03-19"
author: "#1 Jiang Jiang"
slug: 'huan-post'
---
```
